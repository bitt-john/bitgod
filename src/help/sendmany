sendmany "fromaccount" <recipients> ( minconf "comment" instant "sequenceId" minUnspentSize enforceMinConfirmsForChange )

Send multiple times. Amounts are double-precision floating point numbers.

Recipients may be specified either as an object map of address -> amount (as in bitcoind), or
more flexibly as an array of objects. The array form allows producing multiple outputs to the
same destination address, as well as attaching Travel Rule information if desired.

Arguments:
1. "fromaccount"         (string, required) DEPRECATED. The account to send the funds from. Should be "" for the default account
2. "recipients"          (array or object, required)
         OBJECT FORM:    { "ADDRESS1": amount1, "ADDRESS2": amount2, ... }
         ARRAY FORM :    [ { "address": "ADDRESS1", "amount": amount1 }, { "address": "ADDRESS1", "amount": amount2, "travelInfo": {...} }, ... ]

3. minConf                          (numeric, optional, default=1) Only use the balance confirmed at least this many times.
4. "comment"                        (string, optional) A comment
5. instant                          (boolean, optional, default=false) Send this transaction as BitGo Instant
6. "sequenceId"                     (string, optional) A client-provided sequence id, which must be unique within this wallet.
7. minUnspentSize                   (numeric, optional) minimum satoshi value to use when selecting unspents
8. enforceMinConfirmsForChange      (boolean, optional, default=false) Require change unspents to adhere to minConf

Result:
"transactionid"          (string) The transaction id for the send. Only 1 transaction is created regardless of
                                    the number of addresses.

Examples:

Send two amounts to two different addresses:
> bitcoin-cli sendmany "" "{\"1D1ZrZNe3JUo7ZycKEYQQiQAWd9y54F4XZ\":0.01,\"1353tsE8YMTA4EuV7dgUXGjNFf9KpVvKHz\":0.02}"

Send two amounts to two the same address using BitGoInstant, using minimum 1-confirm inputs, setting comment and sequence id
> bitcoin-cli sendmany "" '[ {"address": "1D1ZrZNe3JUo7ZycKEYQQiQAWd9y54F4XZ", "amount":0.01, "address": "1D1ZrZNe3JUo7ZycKEYQQiQAWd9y54F4XZ", amount:0.02 }]" 1 "testing" true kj2d9sd32
